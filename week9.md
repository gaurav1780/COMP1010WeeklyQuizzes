# Week 9 (Lists- 2)


### Iterator vs enhanced for loop
Select if an enhanced for loop or iterator would be most effective.

Enhanced
* Accessing all items in the list from the front.
* Sum all positive numbers in the list.

Iterator
* Accessing all items in the list from the back.
* Accessing all items in the second half of the list.
* Finding the index of the first `20` (if it exists in the list).
* Setting every odd number in the list to 0.
* Removing all negative numbers in the list.
